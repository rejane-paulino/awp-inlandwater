# (AWP - Inland Water) Adaptative Window by Proportion applied to Inland Water <img src="img/awpinlandwater.svg" width="150" align="right" />

AWP-Inland Water is a proto-algorithm that has been developed to address the reduction of adjacency effect on satellite-imagery applied to small waterbodies. The key principle behind AWP-Inland Water lies in its ability to adapt window-ranges according to local conditions across the waterbodies. For more details about this proto-algorithm, we recommend referring to the comprehensive study conduced by Paulino et al. (2022).   

## Requirements and Usage:

AWP-Inland Water is coded in Python 3.8 and it requires Python packages to run: `numpy`, `pandas`, `gdal`, `cv2`, `py6S`, `xmltodict`, `cython`. 

To run the L-CONNECT, it is necessary a suitable use of the environment `lconnect` by command line:

            conda env create -f environment.yml
            conda activate awp
            cd into the awp-inlandwater directory
            python api.py
