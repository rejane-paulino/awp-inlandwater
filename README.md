# (AWP - Inland Water) Adaptative Window by Proportion applied to Inland Water <img src="img/awpinlandwater.svg" width="150" align="right" />

AWP-Inland Water is a proto-algorithm that has been developed to address the reduction of adjacency effect on satellite-imagery applied to small waterbodies. The key principle behind AWP-Inland Water lies in its ability to adapt window-ranges according to local consitions across the waterbodies. For more details about this proto-algorithm, we recommend referring to the comprehensive study conduced by Paulino et al (2022).
